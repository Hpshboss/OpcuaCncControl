 
# Official OPC UA .Net Standard Stack and Samples from the OPC Foundation

## Overview(參考開源基本介紹)
This OPC UA reference implementation is targeting [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) .

.Net Standard allows you develop apps that run on all common platforms available today, including Linux, iOS, Android (via Xamarin) and Windows 7/8/8.1/10 (including embedded/IoT editions) without requiring platform-specific modifications. 

One of the reference implementations inside this project has been certified for compliance through an OPC Foundation Certification Test Lab to prove its high quality. Fixes and enhancements since the certification process have been tested and verified for compliance using the Compliance Test Tool (CTT) V1.03.

Furthermore, cloud applications and services (such as ASP.Net, DNX, Azure Websites, Azure Webjobs, Azure Nano Server and Azure Service Fabric) are also supported.
