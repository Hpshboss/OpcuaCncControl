# OPC Foundation UA .Net Standard Library Reference Server

## 專案架構在開源的Reference server上

## Introduction(開源基本介紹)
This OPC Server is designed to be the default OPC UA Server when opening the [OPC UA Compliance Test Tool](https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/certification-test-tools/opc-ua-compliance-test-tool-uactt/) and it uses an address-space that matches the design of the UACTT. 

It is built with the Quickstart application template (OPC Server) and uses the OPC Foundation UA .NET Standard Library SDK. Therefore it supports both the opc.tcp and https transports. There is a .Net 4.6 based server with UI and a .Net Standard 2.0 console version of the server which runs on any OS supporting [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/standard).
